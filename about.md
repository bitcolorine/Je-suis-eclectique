This is a website that explores creativity, artistry and talent. My personal road to finding my creative outlet after decades of searching and trying everything. 

In short, this is about the "Someday Creative".  

I've had many blogs. One ran for 8 years. 
I tried all the platforms: Blogger, Typepad, WordPress both the free and the hosted version and Tumblr.
After I closed the 8 year old blog I could never feel at home. I was always afraid I would lose my content, or that it would be impossible to export. Tumblr being the most recent example.

So using my front-end skills and a lot of patience, I decided to give Jekyll a try. My site will always be with me. Though at the moment I'm hosting it on Github pages, if Github pulls [another](http://online.wsj.com/articles/harassment-claims-make-startup-github-grow-up-1405639553) funny stunt, I can simply grab all my files and put them elsewhere.
