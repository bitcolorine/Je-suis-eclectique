My name is Luisa.

This is a website that explores creativity, artistic expression and talent. 

I started to draw in April 2014. 

Before that I didn't believe I could. I'd bought several books on drawing, I had spent a good amount of money on sketchbooks, pencils, erasers, pens, coloured pencils, etc and I never used them.

My desire to create has been present since my childhood but for reasons that are familiar to many of us, I decided to pursue other things.  

When I finally set my pencil to paper I discovered there was no need to draw upside down, or to divide the face into thirds, that I didn't need to use a grid, or learn perspective to draw what I wanted. I entered a period of bliss.

But to get here I've had to try many things: creativity is a vast word and I couldn't narrow down if I wanted to be "creative" or "artistic".

I want to share how I finally found my creative outlet after nine years of trying all sorts of disciplines.  

In short, this is about the Someday Creative, the Eclectic Creative. 

I'm a strange m√©lange of web developer, librarian, bookseller, writer and more recently, illustrator. 

 I speak English, Spanish and French. I love to mix them up.

 The word [Eclectic](http://geniscarreras.com/philographics/#/eclecticism/) defines who I am.

If I have to pick one goal it would be to create and to appreciate other people's beautiful creations. 



<!--I give up on that. I tend to blog in Spanish and French sometimes.

I've had many blogs. One ran for 8 years. 
I tried all the platforms: Blogger, Typepad, WordPress both the free and the hosted version and Tumblr.
After I closed the 8 year old blog I could never feel at home. I was always afraid I would lose my content, or that it would be impossible to export. Tumblr being the most recent example.

So using my front-end skills and a lot of patience, I decided to give Jekyll a try. My site will always be with me. Though at the moment I'm hosting it on Github pages, if Github pulls [another](http://online.wsj.com/articles/harassment-claims-make-startup-github-grow-up-1405639553) funny stunt, I can simply grab all my files and put them elsewhere.
