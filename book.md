	<h1>The Someday Creative</h1>

	<h3>This is a book for the adults who’ve postponed their creativity and artistic expression. </h3>

	<ul>
		<li>For whom the creative spark has never died but has had too many other things to take care of first.</li>
		<li>For the dabbler</li>
		<li>For the talented unawares</li>
		<li>For the person who “would love to that one day”</li>
		<li>For the person with elevated creativity, talent and taste but poor self-discipline</li>
		<li>For those who are intimidated by statements like “I’ve been doing X for one hundred years”</li>
		<li>For those who think they lack focus</li>
		<li>For those who have lost an unmeasurable amount of life consuming what other people make.
</li>
		<li>For people who’s age is an obstacle to creativity and think that only the kids are creative.</li>
		<li>For me who has spent the first four decades of her life searching for the “medium” and trying everything at once.</li>
		
	</ul>




<blockquote class="copy">For me who started drawing and painting at 41 and didn’t know I could.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="copy">For you, who has not given creativity time and place.</blockquote>
