	<h1>The Someday Creative</h1>

	<h3>This is a book for the adults who’ve postponed their creativity and artistic expression. </h3>

	<ul>
		<li>For whom the creative spark has not died but as life happened it was pushed aside.</li>
		<li>For the dabbler</li>
		<li>For the talented unawares</li>
		<li>For the person who “would love to do that one day”</li>
		<li>For the person with elevated creativity, talent and taste but poor self-discipline</li>
		<li>For those who are intimidated by statements like “I’ve been doing X for one hundred years”</li>
		<li>For those who think they lack focus</li>
		<li>For those who have lost an unmeasurable amount of life consuming what other people make.
</li>
		<li>For me who has spent the first four decades of her life searching for the “medium” and trying everything at once.</li>
		
	</ul>




<blockquote class="copy">For me who started drawing and painting at 41 and didn’t know I could.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="copy">For you, if you haven't given creativity a time and a place.</blockquote>

<p class="panel">This is a book that covers the realities, pitfalls and epiphanies of finding your creative outlet, about what it means to be creative, talented and/or artistic 
It's about what to do once you find the art form you were meant to practice.</p>

<h3>What this book is not </h3>

<p>This is not a business book. It will not teach you how monetize anything. It will teach you to hold on to your creativity and, like the good old masters, produce a lot of work for the simple reason that you have no choice.</p>

<h3>If you:</h3>

<ul>

	<li>Are on a never-ending search of creative time and space</li>
<li>Spend obscene amounts of time consuming what other people make</li>
<li>Spend a lot of money learning something or other</li>
<li>You have a folder called "Someday"</li>
<li>You wake up and remember your age before you remember the day of the week</li>
(Whether you're 30, 40 or 50, the desire to make something is mysteriously linked to age)</ul>

<p>I invite you to take a long deep breath of relief, because I can assure you, you can find exactly what you were meant to create. I found it and once I did it took me three months go from zero to satisfied with my </p>

<p>I'm convinced that my best work is ahead and yours is too</p>

Your's is too.</p>
