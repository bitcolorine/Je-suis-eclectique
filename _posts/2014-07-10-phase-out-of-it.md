#Phasing out of it

The act of writing is always intriguing. To see someone writing, cracks my curiosity wide open. I'm curious about everyone but I prefer the act of making up stories in my head as opposed to knowing the real story. It could be more fascinating or less but I prefer my own.

When I was young, I saw a classmate writing what seemed a letter. Without any consciense whatsoever I asked what she was writing and she replied: mind your own business!

This stuck with me. How dare I ask someone what he or she is writing, how dare I ask what he or she is about? 
This is why I dislike small talk so much. It's the act of never finding out what the person is about and yet, I always set a limit as to what I'm allowed to ask, even if it's well know that people love to talk about themselves.

When blogs came along, it was paradise for me because I could read other people's notebooks! Other people's inner thoughts, something I could never do before. And they didn't even have to know I was reading. Suddenly everyone was fascinating. I put people who blogged in an entire different category than everyday people: they were interesting. And I also blogged, so I was interesting too. For an introvert, this was paradise. I "talked" to people left and right, I started my email conversations with direct questions, no beating around the bush, no: where are you from? Do you have brothers and sisters? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Empathy flowed freely. People wrote like no one was reading and it was beautiful.

## Monetizing, Social Networks, How-to's, Coaches

Then at one point there was this strange shift, with the democratization of blogging platforms out came the business world. 

> It was inevitable. Every revolution gets televised, monetized and ultimately killed. Just look at what's happening to  Net Neutrality. Look at natural resources.
