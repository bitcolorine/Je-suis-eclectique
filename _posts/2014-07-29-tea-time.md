##It's Tea Time


There are wishes, some people want to call them goals, but I prefer wishes, they're dreamier and not intimidating. These wishes are recurrent, they live deep down in your subconscious and they are fool-proof clues.

I was a web designer a long time ago. I wanted to refresh my skills and become a web developer. But the wish I kept verbalizing was: I want to build my own website  from scratch.

Every time I started to learn a new technology, I went back to: yes but I will build my website from scratch.

I started learning HTML5 and CSS3 again. Then I decided to take up on WordPress. 

[Variable Skies](http://www.variableskies.com) was built off a free theme and I just fiddled with the CSS. Not my website. 

In December 2013 I bookmarked a Github pages tutorial that appeared on 24 Ways. 
I didn't even attempt to try it. I was too busy with WordPress, learning it and hating it. 

[Ashley Baxter](http://iamashley.co.uk/blog/how-i-learned-to-code-and-why-there-is-no-shortcut/) has written about the importance of having a project when  you want to learn something. 
If you are going to learn to build websites, you need to have a project. A real one or it won't work. (More so if you want to build an app  lest you lose yourself in the million and one tutorials out there, your life will pass you by.)

Let me restate that: You need to have a project that you care about.

**Side Track**
This year I discovered I could draw. It was an accident, I stumbled into it finally after, again, years of wishing I could draw.  Not only did I know how to draw, I discovered that I had an ability to create fashion illustrations. 
This discovery pulled me away from web development for a while which was salutary.

After achieving complete disconnection, I went back to that 24 Ways tutorial and took it slowly. Working a bit at a time each day. First following the tutorial step by step, then changing it a bit until it went from a blank, HTML website with blue links to what it is now.

**Back on track.**

I'm not going to be a freelance web developer. That was never my aim. I wanted to learn how to develop websites to have a part-time side gig. But I soon discovered that what I needed to learn was not what I wanted to learn. 

##Rounding up

*I love simple, fast, easy to read websites. 
*I like websites that feel like someone's home.
A WP site doesn't feel like that. I visited many Jekyll sites. They were simple, mostly built by developers but later I discovered a few that taken their Jekyll sites further with lovely design and ultra fast.

That's what appealed to me, something that works, something that weights very little and that allows people to read the content without a million sponsors and distracting widgets.

It made sense for me to focus on that simplicity. 

##The Tools:

*Github Pages offer free hosting. They allow only HTML, CSS and JavaScript
*But I wanted a blog, so Jekyll was the immediate choice. 
*A CSS framework, I chose Foundation.
*Sublime Text for code editor
*Git for version control
*Terminal

The tutorials I followed:

*To understand Github Pages: 
[Getting Started with Github Pages](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/)
*Understanding Jekyll
[Video on Getting Started with Jekyll](http://youtu.be/iWowJBRMtpc)
*[Jekyll by example](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example)
*Git
The most comprehensive [Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git) 
*[Jekyll Documentation ](http://jekyllrb.com/) which could be a bit more accessible for non-developers. 
*[Websites built with Jekyll ](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites)
I spent quite a bit of time here because many of these are abandoned sites, but to be listed there you need to have the source code public, therefore lots of bits to learn.


## Is there a market for Static Websites?

I have no idea. I imagine so because there are several tools to generate static sites, some are Open Source like Jekyll and Middleman, or Statamic (a proper CMS which requires a license).

The problem is that these tools would be challenging for non-technical users.

To update your content you need to go into your code and into the repository so this represents a poor choice for clients who want to manage their sites on their own.
And you can't publish on a whim from your phone but then again, sitting down and composing a post is more mindful than dictating it to Siri.

There are a few tools like Octopress (which I haven't tried) and [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) to quickly create blog posts. Normally I compose my posts on [draftin.com](http://draftin.com) and then copy/paste them into sublime text, commit and push live. 

I know it's kind of retrograde when I could simply login to a WordPress dashboard and type away, hit publish and be done, but building my site with Jekyll has allowed me to learn how to build a workflow for myself and it allowed me to learn things in context.


##So why again?

Because I want my site to be portable,
I want to have it in my hard drive
I want it to be secure
I don't want to have to update plugins and versions and be afraid of losing everything if an update goes awry.
I don't want a bloated CMS injecting p tags all over the place.
I like writing in Markdown
And I want free hosting.

So after all this, I'm drinking my black tea with milk Brit style and marvelling at the fact that I built my site from scratch (ok, minus Foundation but I just wanted the grid).
