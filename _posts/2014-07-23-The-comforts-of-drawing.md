## The comforts of drawing

Last week I read a beautiful lyrical essay in Rookie magazine. Rookie is a teen magazine; of course I'm not a teenager but it came to me through Ann Friedman whose newsletter I subscribe to. 
The first paragraph was like a punch in the stomach: "yes, this is it."

I wonder about the journalist who wrote it, her age, she certainly is not a teenager either, I think she might be in her twenties.
Anyway, age is on my mind a lot these days for three reasons:

One is I am in fact, 41 years old.
Two I don't feel or look like 41. 
Though I don't feel or look like 41, everything I have wanted to do in the past year has the intrusive number hanging over it. 

There are times, like when reading this article, that I'm reminded quite bluntly about the fact that I've been four decades on this planet and that for four decades I've had a terrible anxiety problem. 

I've tried everything in my power to apease my mind.
Like the writer: I was born into a loving family, I've had an overall happy life, but my anxiety issues are independent of that.

Meditation, praying, psychology, psiquiatry, chemicals. Yoga, coaching, knitting, coding, more chemicals, herbs, teas, everything.

I used to believe in eating 12 grapes in the New Year, tradition that originated in Spain and was adopted by some Latin American countries. You take 12 grapes and with each of the 12 bell tolls you eat one and make a wish.

Every year until 2006 I made my wishes and every year my number one wish was: peace of mind. 

It's written over and over in my diaries: _Lo Ãºnico que quiero es paz mental._ (The only thing I want is peace of mind).

Anxiety is the horrible thoughts that jumps unexpectedly at you when you're happy just to ruin the moment and the horrible thoughts that make you go into full-blown panic when you're in a bad place. It's a constant battle. One might as well hang a sign around one's neck: "Warning, dark cloud coming your way".

Doing creative things occupies my mind to a certain extent and most of my chosen activities have been geared to that, to have moments of oblivion. 

Knitting offered me some calm, but as soon as I got the hang of the knitting pattern I could easily go back to my personal nuclear-disaster movie. 

Coding also helps, but I feel like a blob after sitting for three hours looking at Sublime Text and then I go back to my personal nuclear-disaster movie.

Writing activiates the mind but offers relief. Brain dumps are delicious. But you guessed it... 

Drawing however, provided the oxygen mask my choking brain was screaming for. 

### Consuming vs. Creating
The DIY movement caught my attention in the late 90's with the Riot Grrrl Zines. A few years later knitting became trendy. Debbie Stroller's book Stitch n' Bitch came out, Madonna and Julia Roberts were photographed knitting away. Ready Made Magazine fell on my lap. But I was tucked away in a city in Mexico where at the time the exciting things that were happening on the internet didn't arrive.

I tried many things but quickly realized I was not craft inclined. I became a consumer of other people's work and to give some relief to my non-participation I became a pseudo-curator. 

I kept writing and writing. Short stories, essays, blog posts, music reviews, journals all this in English and in Spanish. 

A part from knitting I tried my hand at bookbinding, making recycled paper, artisanal soap and candles. 

But secretely I wanted to draw.

I never did because I believed I couldn't. I tried a couple of times, I made tiny flat comics but they didn't look "nice" and I told myself I couldn't.

I'm not exaggerating when I say "for years". 

For years I've wanted to draw and create fabulous visual journals
I wanted to document my life visually instead of digitally.
I wanted to make postcards for people I loved.

I drooled over visual arts but I kept saying to myself: you want to be a writer. Don't get distracted.

When the blog era came into the world I went into it happily and when we all started to share our creations, a great divide happened:

The makers vs. the consumers.

YouTube exacerbated this. And for some of us, the choice was overwhelming. 

Books have been published about this, the inability to choose. 

Or what I call the unwillingness to choose. So we drink up, the fresh content, the talent, the creation of other people. 

And we think: I could never...


### Two wishes

So my first wish was peace of mind
My second wish was to draw.

How I didn't make the connection earlier escapes me. Yet we're on the road of "should" most of the time and I ran on it.

In 2009 I bought the book "Drawing on the right side of the brain", I attempted the first couple of exercises and once again, became convinced that even though my upside-down drawing was incredible to me, I dropped it because it felt artificial.

One day in 2012 I bumped into a tutorial on YouTube. An obnoxious teenager who was falling all over his chair and laughing gave me the secret to drawing portraits. 
"Distance and shapes". If you are an artist you might be saying "duh!". But right then I made a portrait and it wasn't bad. I dismissed it as an accident.

Then I tried Zentangles and Doodles, sadly it wasn't what I wanted. 

Fast forward to 2013, I bought "You Can Draw in 30 days" and I started to do the excercises meticulously. 
It bored me to tears but this time I was determined. 

I went through 80% of the book and it was a failure. My sketchbook was anything but beautiful or interesting. Spheres and lines and triangles, spaceships did not match my wishes.

In early 2014 in the depths of the Montreal winter I bought set of watercolours. 
Why? I wondered, if I can't draw I certainly can't paint.

I found a referral for a Skillshare trial and I enrolled in a watercolour class. 

The first painting I completed in watercolour took me about 40 minutes and when I finished I realized how peaceful my mind felt. 

A connection was made and suddenly I was drawing and painting non-stop.
Something had unblocked.
My drawings were good.
My sketchbook took shape.

And during the moments I paint or draw, my mind is at peace.

So how does this tie with creativity, talent and artistic inclinations?
How do you let go and begin to produce your own work?


This is what my upcoming book is about. 
It's truly a labor of love for myself first, for those years of chasing peace of mind and for my fellow creatively anxious or anxiously creative.
