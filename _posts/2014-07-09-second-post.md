## Phew!

I have been struggling with this thing for so long. I do not have a programmers brain. No "if this then that" logic. I'm more like "if this, everything or nothing".
With Jekyll I need to get familiar with Markdown and a whole new way of writing and editing. 
Doing a lot of stuff by hand like naming my posts correctly, adding the headings and stuff more automatically than looking up stuff.
But I'm happy. This looks very generic and very boring. I hope to make it interesting and visually pleasing.

There is much I want to write here and thus the name of the blog. 

It feels good to build something by piecing together bits of documentation, tutorials and such. But most of all it feels great to do it little by little (although I did slave for a couple of days.)

Let's publish this.
