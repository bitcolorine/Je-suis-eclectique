## The time to write the book

I'm writing a book. 
For real this time.
It's not one of the abandoned novels.
Nor is it the carefully edited version of my first blog, scraped from the personal, and left with the image of the earlier days of the web.
It's also not a short story anthology.

This is a book about the "Someday Creative". Which is me, and probably a lot of people too.
The people who have pushed aside their creative outlet because (choose one or choose them all)

* They wanted to be something, an author, a painter, a DJ, a chef, but they only liked the label, not the activity in itself. 
* They couldn't see their natural creative patterns
* They were confused about ["should and must."](https://medium.com/@elleluna/the-crossroads-of-should-and-must-90c75eb7c5b0) 
* They thought: someday, after I've done this and that.
* They were in a hurry to *be someone* instead of *making things*

I've spent nearly a decade trying to find and define my creative outlet. I have consumed a lot of creative advice across many fields because I'm a curious monster, but didn't hit the breaks in the information overload truck. I thought that by 35 I would be a published fiction author and have a successful career as a Marketing professional because *that's what I studied for* 

However, I'm not. I'm working at a job that doesn't pay much, but that in exchange, allows me to be myself and have an enormous flexibility in my schedule. And I've stayed in that job because it left me time to *do what I loved* but the problem was that I didn't know what it was. In fact, it just left me time to *search*.

I have been on the search for so long and I've done everything you can ever imagine without the certainty of: yes this is it, this is what I want to do.

Then I had the opportunity to spend three months in a tiny village in France and the a decade of search became three months of discovery. At last!

I'm in my 40's now. It's exciting and scary at the same time. Scary because you see the new generations rising creatively to heights never possible for me in my 20s, but also it's exciting because I know *both worlds* the high-speed, internet-driven, social world, and the world without it, and creativity sometimes needs the latter. 

I don't have to read about any of it. I've lived both times. 

This is a book that covers the realities, pitfals and epiphanies of finding your creative outlet, about what it means to be creative, talented and/or artistic 
It's about what to do once you find your artform.

**What this book is not**
This is not a business book. It will not teach you how monetize anything. It will teach you to hold on to your creativity and like the good old masters and produce because you have no choice.
I will however, because it's in my nature, provide a short list of artists whose creativity and unique style has allowed them to make a living from their art.
The how is up to each one of us.
