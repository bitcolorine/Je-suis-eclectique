# I'm trying to make sense

So this Jekyll thing is looking good. I wonder if I'll get used to writing everything by hand, until I get to using some sort of task runner or whatnot.
Meanwhile, I just want to build a basic page so I can move Variableskies.com to here.

How do you include a link to the blog in the main nav? 

Ah, what a drag to ask this silly question. Carrying on.
